Concepts for implementation in the project:

- dependency injection (injectable) âœ…
- class-validator (controller validation) âœ…
- config service âœ…
- module âœ…
- exception filter âœ… 
- provider, provider factory âœ…
- scopes ( specific to NestJs ) ðŸ¤” - return to it at the end 
- Guard ( use jwt ), middleware, interceptor (and their differences) 
    ( implement guard and add logger middleware, but not interceptor)
- unit tests ðŸ¤”?

general todos:
1) index export files
2) Now i need to check if i can pull all of the book borrowed by a user, or all the users that borrowed the book.
- ( Only work on the typeOrm SQL queries that are necessary according to the figma plan )
3) Make sure i implement comments from both sakads !
4) Enforce eslint, ido gave me an example file
5) I need to actually understand the whole db - repository configuration.
6) Make all the service classes use typeOrm query builders - similar to how it is in the writer-service 
7) 

20/11 Todo:
1) Implement search query DTO for books aswell
2) Replan routes in a much more exact manner
3)
