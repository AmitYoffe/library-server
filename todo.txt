Concepts for implementation in the project:

- dependency injection (injectable) âœ…
- class-validator (controller validation) âœ…
- config service âœ…
- module âœ…
- exception filter âœ… 
- provider, provider factory âœ…
- Guard ( use jwt ), middleware, interceptor (and their differences) âœ…
- scopes ( specific to NestJs ) ðŸ¤” - return to it at the end 
- unit tests ( Write and test some service & controller )

1) Fix bug with index export files
2) Enforce eslint, ido gave me an example file
3) Make sure I Implement comments from both sakads !
4) Write and test some service & controller
5) Do not return a reponses to the client, just a status code ( some exception are allowed ).
6)
